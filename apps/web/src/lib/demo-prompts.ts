## How to Integrate 0G Storage with Your AI Tutors

### Step 1: Store System Prompts
\`\`\`typescript
import { storeAvatarPrompts } from '@/lib/demo-prompts'

// Store all demo prompts on 0G Storage
const results = await storeAvatarPrompts('your-private-key')
console.log('Storage results:', results)
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Update Avatar Data
\`\`\`typescript
import { updateAvatarsWith0GData } from '@/lib/demo-prompts'

// Update your avatars with 0G storage references
const updatedAvatars = updateAvatarsWith0GData(originalAvatars, storageResults)
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Verify During Runtime
\`\`\`typescript
import { verifyAvatarPrompts } from '@/lib/demo-prompts'

// Verify prompt integrity before using
const verification = await verifyAvatarPrompts({
  'math-tutor': '0x1234...hash',
  'science-buddy': '0x5678...hash'
})
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Display Verification Status
The VerificationBadge component automatically shows:
- ‚úÖ Verified Safe (green)
- üîç Under Review (yellow)
- ‚ùå Not Verified (red)
- ‚è≥ Pending Review (gray)

This creates a complete trust system where parents and educators can verify that AI tutors are using approved, immutable educational content.
